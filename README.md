# Introduction

This a sinatra application that plays the classic game of Lights Out on a 6x6 grid via your browser. It was made between completing Launch School courses RB175 and RB185, which teach how to create networked applications and database applications using Ruby.

While I do not have this version live, I do have a modified version based on this one and the [HTRB sample I made](https://github.com/Christopher-R-Perkins/blink-out-htmx/tree/main) live at [https://blink.quasari.dev](https://blink.quasari.dev)
